#REstful web services

user is related to "social media post" resouce mapping

basepath: https://localhost:8080
#Related to user -> all methods will go in service layer in MVC
1. Retrieve all user: GET/users
2. create a user: POST /users/
3. Retrieve a specific user: /Users/{id}
4. DELETE a user: DELETE /users/{id}

#Related  to post of a user
1. retrieve all post of a user: GET/users/{id}/posts
2. create a post for specific user: POST /user/{id}/posts
3. get details of a specific post: GET /Users/{id}/posts/{post_id}


things will take care:
-versioning
-exception handling
-internalization

Important points:
-Dispatcher servlet is the fron controller handles are mapping,which controller can handle the request
which mapping is mapped to which function, now how to send the response back (@Response body in @restConroller implementation),
it will do jackson on the response


MVC:
Controller: will handle all the mappings
Model: pojos like user
service: dao service etc. will have methods handling operations nad returning data to controller requested by it.
