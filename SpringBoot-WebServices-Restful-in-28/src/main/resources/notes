things will take care:
-versioning
-exception handling
-internalization

Important points:
-Dispatcher servlet is the fron controller handles are mapping,which controller can handle the request
which mapping is mapped to which function, now how to send the response back (@Response body in @restConroller implementation),
it will do jackson on the response
